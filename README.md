## Problem-solving techniques
#### A problem-solving technique is the process of working through details of a problem to reach a solution. Problem solving may include mathematical or systematic operations and can be a measurement of an individual's critical thinking skills.

## Here are seven-steps for an effective problem-solving process.

### 1. Identify the issues:
#### Be clear about what the problem is.
#### Remember that different people might have different views of what the issues are.

### 2. Understand everyone's interests:
#### Interests are the needs that you want satisfied by any given solution.
#### The best solution is the one that satisfies everyone's interests.
#### This is the time for active listening. Put down your differences for awhile and listen to each other with the intention to understand.

### 3. List the possible solutions:
#### This is the time to do some brainstorming. There may be lots of room for creativity.

### 4. Evaluate the options:
#### What are the pluses and minuses?

### 5. Select an option or options:
#### What's the best option, in the balance?
#### Is there a way to "bundle" a number of options together for a more satisfactory solution?

### 6. Document the agreement(s):
#### Don't rely on memory.
#### Writing it down will help you think through all the details and implications.

### 7. Agree on contingencies, monitoring, and evaluation:
#### Conditions may change. Make contingency agreements about foreseeable future circumstances.
#### How will you monitor compliance and follow-through?
#### Create opportunities to evaluate the agreements and their implementation.

## CPD
#### CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development. It refers to the process of tracking and documenting the skills, knowledge and experience that you gain both formally and informally as you work, beyond any initial training. It's a record of what you experience, learn and then apply. The term is generally used to mean a physical folder or portfolio documenting your development as a professional.

## Importance of CPD
#### CPD is one of the most important terms for a professional, being able to keep up to date on what the newest developments with the field of work means that someone can keep being good at their job, because of the world always developing, professionals must also develop around it. If someone doesn't keep up to date then it will be difficult for that person to keep up with their job, as companies are constantly looking to improve it means that the employees will also have to look at improving with it to stay at that company. Without it companies would lose a lot of their profit having to constantly hire new people, this would mean spending more money on training new staff rather than improving the company needs. This is why CPD is so important to companies and individuals, as it keeps people and companies from becoming outdated.

## Effective CPD
#### Whichever form your CPD takes, evidence shows that the most effective CPD is that which is:
#### • Personalised – ie built on your identified needs and requirements rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach.
#### • Relevant – relates to your teaching theory and/or subject specialism and the needs of your learners.
#### • Sustained – New skills and ideas need time to take hold; experimentation and refinement is the best way to embed new ideas into your classroom practice.
#### • Supported – by coaching or mentoring from experienced colleagues, either from within or from outside your school.
#### • Collaborative – while teaching could be seen as a solitary profession, collaboration with your fellow teachers and colleagues has been identified as one of the most relevant features required for teacher learning.

## Motivational Theories 
### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:
#### This is the theory that people will have certain priorities based on what level they want to work, put down to basic survival the analogy is if someone is stranded in the forest, people will first aim for basic survival, however once people have had basic survival close to mastered, they will look to improve on their condition with shelter or simialar things. This is the same in the workplace and people that have recently joined a company will be looking at a basic survival on doing tasks whereas others who have worked for a longer period of time will want to achieve the next level, therefore giving them more complex jobs might prove useful.

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Model:
#### This is the theory that there is either satisfaction or dissatisfaction within a work enviroment, with satisfaction being within achievement or forms of advancement within the workplace that could include salary rise or more important roles. However the dissatisfaction can be included within work conditions, salary and also relationships with peers. According to the theory, these factors must be managed effectivley in order to motivate the employees correctly. It is the employers job to manage these factors if they want the business to be successful.

## Future Development Plan
