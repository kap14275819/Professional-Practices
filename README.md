## Problem-solving techniques
#### A problem-solving technique is the process of working through details of a problem to reach a solution. Problem solving may include mathematical or systematic operations and can be a measurement of an individual's critical thinking skills.

## Here are seven-steps for an effective problem-solving process.

### 1. Identify the issues:
#### Be clear about what the problem is.
#### Remember that different people might have different views of what the issues are.

### 2. Understand everyone's interests:
#### Interests are the needs that you want satisfied by any given solution.
#### The best solution is the one that satisfies everyone's interests.
#### This is the time for active listening. Put down your differences for awhile and listen to each other with the intention to understand.

### 3. List the possible solutions:
#### This is the time to do some brainstorming. There may be lots of room for creativity.

### 4. Evaluate the options:
#### What are the pluses and minuses?

### 5. Select an option or options:
#### What's the best option, in the balance?
#### Is there a way to "bundle" a number of options together for a more satisfactory solution?

### 6. Document the agreement(s):
#### Don't rely on memory.
#### Writing it down will help you think through all the details and implications.

### 7. Agree on contingencies, monitoring, and evaluation:
#### Conditions may change. Make contingency agreements about foreseeable future circumstances.
#### How will you monitor compliance and follow-through?
#### Create opportunities to evaluate the agreements and their implementation.

## CPD
#### CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development. It refers to the process of tracking and documenting the skills, knowledge and experience that you gain both formally and informally as you work, beyond any initial training. It's a record of what you experience, learn and then apply. The term is generally used to mean a physical folder or portfolio documenting your development as a professional. 

## Importance of CPD
#### CPD is one of the most important terms for a professional, being able to keep up to date on what the newest developments with the field of work means that someone can keep being good at their job, because of the world always developing, professionals must also develop around it. If someone doesn't keep up to date then it will be difficult for that person to keep up with their job, as companies are constantly looking to improve it means that the employees will also have to look at improving with it to stay at that company. Without it companies would lose a lot of their profit having to constantly hire new people, this would mean spending more money on training new staff rather than improving the company needs. This is why CPD is so important to companies and individuals, as it keeps people and companies from becoming outdated.
